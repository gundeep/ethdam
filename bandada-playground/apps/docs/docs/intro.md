# What is Bandada?

Bandada is an infrastructure to manage privacy-preserving groups. It also provides antisybil mechanisms by using credential groups so that you can only join a group if you meet a specific criteria.

Bandada is a public good project. It is free and open source. Everyone can use it and contribute to it.

- Bandada is a Spanish word that means **group of birds**. It is the same as the English word **flock**.
